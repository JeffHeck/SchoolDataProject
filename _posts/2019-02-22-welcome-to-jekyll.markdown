This site is devoted to analyzing school data to inform and assist parents, taxpayers and policy makers with their school related decisions.
Currently, Washington State's K-12 schools are covered.

Latest additions: 
- added charts for each district for historical and projected total enrollments.
- added charts for each district for historical and projected budget amounts for the general fund.
- updated the state-wide charts (see the reports section) on general fund amounts to include revenues, expenses, net, and balance.
