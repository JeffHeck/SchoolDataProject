A school data analysis project initiated by Jeff Heckathorn.

Pertinent statistics and charts are presented on K-12 schools in Washington State. This site is devoted to analyzing school data to inform and assist parents, taxpayers and policy makers with their school related decisions. The current emphasis is analyzing school districts' finances including teacher and administrator total compensation packages. 

Washington is in the midst of turmoil as the McCleary decision and resulting law changes take effect. There has been a long history of unequal funding for the 300+ school districts in Washington. It is not clear yet if the McCleary related changes will help or hinder student learning while being fair to taxpayers in the Evergreen State.
