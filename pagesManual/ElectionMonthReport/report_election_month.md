## Summary

They can only run their measures twice in 1 calendar year if it should fail in their first attempt. 
This report summarizes the school district tax measures (bonds and levies) that were on the ballot for the time span of 2010 thru 2023 (4/25/23).

## Possible reasons why school districts prefer February
- February is the lowest voter turnout month of the year for the general public (usually less than 33%).
- School district staff voter turnout is high (70-85%). It can affect the percent approval of their measures by 2-4 percentage points.
- Pro/con committee members for the voters’ pamphlet must volunteer before mid December. Most citizens are unaware of tax measures that will be on the February election and are focusing on the holidays.
- Most citizens are unaware of the pro/con committee volunteer due date.
- By statute, school districts are supposed to find and select pro and con committee members for their own measures. They readily find pro committee members but rarely find con committee members. 
Up to 3 people are supposed to be on each committee - not just 1.
- County election reps are supposed to try to find con committee members when districts fail in their duty. 
- County election reps only have a day or two to find con committee members and they usually fail. 
- Therefore, the voters’ pamphlets usually have a one-sided debate with only a pro statement published.
- Prior to 2022, school districts had the option of allowing a voters’ pamphlet for the February and April elections. Most school districts opted to not allow them. The law changed as of 2022. 
Now all elections must have a voters’ pamphlet. The August and November elections have always had required voters’ pamphlets.
- Property tax bills for the current year won’t be received by citizens until a day or two after the February election.
- Federal Income Tax filings are not until April.
- School district consultants advise their clients that school district tax measures are easier to pass in February.
- The added expense to districts (taxpayers) of running measures in February or April (when their measure is usually the only one on the ballot) does not seem to be an obstacle.
