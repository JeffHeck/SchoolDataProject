___

## Cowlitz County

### County Assessor's Report For The Longview SD

### The Author's Review

- Cowlitz County Assessor's reps correctly allowed the sample parcel's AV, in their example, 
to increase at the same rate as the assumed growth for the total AV. 
- This logic used by Cowlitz gives the same results as the Proportional Obligation Factor (POF) method that the author used in the cost impact estimate calculators. The one difference being that the 
calculators also have a parameter for a POF annual change factor to account for new construction growth or other factors.

## King County

### County Assessor's Report For An Issaquah SD Area Parcel

![King County Report](pagesManual/LeviesReport/20220426/KingCountyCostAnalysisWithBorder.png "King County Report")

### The Author's Review

- King County has had a Taxpayer Transparency Tool since 2018.
- King County has recently, for this April 26th 2022 election, added a stacked bar chart showing a 4 year history of property taxes for each parcel. That is a positive, useful step.
- However, King County fails on providing logical, accurate, mathematically valid tax impacts of the measures that voters are facing.
- The "Educational Programs & Operations Levy" is supposed to be now called an "Enhancement Levy."
- The 2 main tax measures are each 4 years long. The county is only giving an estimate for the 1st year of the new 4 year levies. And the information for that 1 year is incorrect.
- The 1st year of the new levies is the lowest in tax amount of the 4 years that the school district will collect.
- The county is comparing years 2022 and 2023. It should be comparing the entire 4 year new levies with the entire 4 year prior levies. 
- The last year of the prior 4 year levies was the highest amount for the prior levies. King County is comparing the highest amount year of the previous levies with the lowest amount year of the new levies. 
This is giving taxpayers a false, underestimated cost impact.
- The county is using the assumed tax rates supplied by the school district for 2023. But the county is not using the assumed total AV that the school district is using. 
This is illogical, invalid and mathematically incorrect. It all leads to underestimating the cost impact to taxpayers.
- While King County deserves commending for starting a Taxpayer Transparency Tool, it earns a failing grade when it comes to implementation. 
King County is giving its voters false, underestimated cost impact information.
