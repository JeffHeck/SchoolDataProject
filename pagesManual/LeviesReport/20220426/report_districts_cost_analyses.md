### The Author's Review

The Kennewick SD's cost analysis has the following problems:
- The assessed value for the example home stays flat while the district assumes that the total AV (all other homes, apartments and businesses) appreciates. This underestimates the cost impact to the parcel owner.

## Clark County, Ridgefield SD, Bond

### Cost Impact Information Posted On The District's Website

![Ridgefield](pagesManual/LeviesReport/20220426/RidgefieldDistrictCostAnalysisWithBorder.png "Ridgefield")

### The Author's Review

The Ridgefield SD's cost analysis has the following problems:
- The district does not mention the estimated interest and fees that will add another $20M on top of the $62M principal. That $20M was an estimate from a bond management service organization back in December and a more realistic figure would be around $30M+. So another 50% on top of principal. 
- A more realistic annual cost for a parcel with an assessed valued at $550,000 as of 2022 would be $446 for 20 years.
