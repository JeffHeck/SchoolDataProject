## Summary
There are 39 counties in WA. The King County Assessor’s office is the only one in the state with a Tax Transparency Tool (TTT). 
Unfortunately, King County’s implementation is flawed and gives incorrect information. The TTT’s methodology is illogical and 
usually grossly underestimates the cost impact to property taxpayers. And that is the case for the school district tax measures 
for the November 7th 2023 election.

___

## Enumclaw SD Bond
For an actual district tax area property with a 2023 AV of $647,000:

The TTT shows a cost impact for 2024 of $423

The TTT shows a cost impact for 2024 of -$188

See the next image with the red border.

![TTT report for a Kent SD tax area example property](pagesManual/LeviesReport/20231107/TTT/TTT_KentSDExampleParcelRedacted.png "Kent SD tax area example property")

2024 tax of $0 since the district is running the levy a year too early. 

Taxes won’t be collected on the measure until 2025. 

Annual average cost would be $1,221 for 3 years from 2025 through 2027

Total cost of $3,662

## Skykomish SD Tech Levy

For an actual district tax area property with a 2023 AV of $263,000:

The TTT shows a cost impact for 2024 of $67.40

See the next image with the red border.

![TTT report for a Skykomish SD tax area example property](pagesManual/LeviesReport/20231107/TTT/TTT_SkykomishSDExampleParcel2Redacted.png "Skykomish SD tax area example property")

The author’s logical calculator gives the following cost info:

2024 tax of $60. The tax will also be $60 for the other 3 years from 2025 through 2027. 
 
Total cost of $239

The reason the TTT is off by over 10% is that the TTT reps seem to have blindly used the guesstimated future tax rate from the school district. 

This proposed capital levy is for the same amount each year for the 4 years of the previous levy and the 4 years of the proposed levy. 

$75,000 each year: for years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 for the previous levy.

$75,000 each year: for years 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 for the new proposed levy.

The actual taxes in dollars should be approximately the same for each parcel with perhaps a slight decrease (1%) due to new construction.

## Conclusion
The King County Assessor’s office at least has tried to provide taxpayers with a property tax cost impact tool.  The other county 
assessors in the other 38 counties in WA have nothing similar to assist voters with their tax measure voting decisions. 

The existing King County TTT implementation is, unfortunately, flawed and is not using sound accounting principles. 
All 39 county assessors in WA should collaborate and devise a Tax Transparency Tool that uses best practices in accounting and finance. 
Voters/taxpayers deserve a reliable property tax cost impact estimating tool. 

School district levy measures are usually from 2 to 6 years. Bond measures are usually from 15 to 25 years. Most school districts engineer 
their taxing schedule to 
be increasing each year - often substantially back loading the payments (taxes to collect). The TTT is only looking at the 1st year of the levy 
or bond. 
And the TTT's analysis of that 1st year is usually erroneous. For the Kent SD's Enrichment Levy the TTT is not even looking at the 1st year of the 
new levy. It is looking at the last year of the existing Enrichment Levy which makes no sense. 
All of this is woefully inadequate and is a disservice to voters/taxpayers. The TTT is a waste of taxpayer money. And worse, the information 
that it provides underestimates the true cost to voters/taxpayers for these multi-year tax measures. The other 38 counties in WA are 
wise to continue to refuse to use the King County Tax Transparency Tool.


The TTT info for the November 7, 2023 election measures just became available October 20, 2023 – which was after voting started. The TTT 
should have useful, accurate, trustworthy information and it should be completed several months before voting starts and before the pro/con 
arguments are due for the voters’ pamphlet. So for the November 7, 2023 election measures, the TTT should have been completed and online 
before August 1, 2023.

For the next election, February 13, 2024, the pro/con arguments will be due December 15, 2023. The TTT needs to be dramatically improved 
using simple, common sense accounting principles and should be completed for the applicable parcels with tax measures before the 
December 15, 2023 deadline.

The TTT implementers need to provide independent analysis. They should ignore the future tax rate guesses by the school districts and other 
taxing districts. Voters are voting on amounts - not rates.
