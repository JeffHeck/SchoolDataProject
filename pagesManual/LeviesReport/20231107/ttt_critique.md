## Summary
There are 39 counties in WA. The King County Assessor’s office is the only one in the state with a Tax Transparency Tool (TTT). 
Unfortunately, King County’s implementation is flawed and gives incorrect information. The TTT’s methodology is illogical and 
usually grossly underestimates the cost impact to property taxpayers. And that is the case for the school district tax measures 
for the November 7th 2023 election.

## Conclusion
The King County Assessor’s office at least has tried to provide taxpayers with an impact tool.  The other county assessors in the other 38 
counties in WA have nothing to assist voters with their tax measure decisions. 

The existing TTT implementation is unfortunately flawed and is not using sound accounting principles. 
All 39 county assessors in WA should collaborate and devise a Tax Transparency Tool that uses best practices in accounting and finance. 
Voters/taxpayers deserve a reliable property tax cost impact estimating tool.
