## Summary
There are 39 counties in WA. The King County Assessor’s office is the only one in the state with a Tax Transparency Tool (TTT). 
Unfortunately, King County’s implementation is flawed and gives incorrect information. The TTT’s methodology is illogical and 
usually grossly underestimates the cost impact to property taxpayers. And that is the case for the school district tax measures 
for the November 7th 2023 election.
