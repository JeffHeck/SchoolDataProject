title: An Analysis Of School Districts' Cost Impact Analyses Of Their April 23rd 2024 Tax Measures
permalink: report_analysis_of_districts_cost_analyses_20240423
---

Last updated: March 26th, 2024

Preliminary: in progress

## Summary
Taxpayers deserve and expect a logical and accurate accounting of the property tax cost impacts of the school district tax measures that are on the ballot. It is expected that 
the Truth In Lending Act (TILA) guidelines be voluntarily followed. TILA guidelines are of course mandatory for bankers (home mortgages) and car loan agents. School districts 
should be teaching and students should be learning about TILA.
