## Summary
From a review of the school district generated property tax cost impact analyses regarding tax measures on the April 2024 election (and on previous elections since 2020), 
it is abundantly clear that Truth In Lending Act (TILA) type guidelines are sorely needed regarding school district tax measures. Most school districts are quite creative in how they present cost 
impact information. There is no standardization. Taxpayers/voters are often confused by the districts' presentations and have no real idea on what the true cost impacts will be. 

An often used cost analysis technique by school districts is to present guesstimated future tax rates covering multiple future years. This practice is nonsense. Guesstimated 
future tax rates depend on guesstimated future Total AVs (assessed values) of all district tax area properties in each future year of the tax measure. The author has 
shown (using basic Algebra) that the only future rates that should be shown, if any, should be based on the current yearâ€™s known Total AV.

Please see the proof on this link 

[Link to the April 23 2024 report](https://schooldataproject.com/report_levies_20240423)

and the calculator on this link 

[Link to the calculator showing the irrelevance of future guesstimated tax rates](https://schooldataproject.com/table_toledo_enrichment_20240213)

Taxpayers expect and deserve a logical and accurate accounting of the multi year property tax cost impacts of the school district tax measures that are on the ballot. It is expected that 
the TILA guidelines be voluntarily followed. TILA guidelines are of course mandatory for banks (home mortgages), car loan agents, and credit card companies. School districts 
should be teaching and students should be learning about TILA.

Almost all school districts make the logic and math error of assuming a guesstimated Total AV growth each year of their tax measure while keeping the AV of their example property constant. This misleads 
voters and underestimates the tax burden on taxpayers. The Yelm School District in Thurston County however provides an online calculator, similar to the author's, that correctly allows their example 
property's AV to change at the same pace as the Total AV. Other school districts should learn from Yelm.

The other standout is the Bickleton SD in Klickitat County. Bickleton's cost analysis clearly shows the amounts in dollars for the future years of the proposed levy and the previous years of the previous levy. They 
are the same amounts each year. Citizens can easily understand that their taxes for this one levy would be the same in dollars no matter what happens to Total AV (and therefore future rates) over those future years. 
Bickleton SD area citizens may still decide to reject the levy but at least they were given accurate cost information.
