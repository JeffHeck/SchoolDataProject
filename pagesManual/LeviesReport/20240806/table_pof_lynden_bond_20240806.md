The data in the next table are from actual properties in the Lynden SD tax area. Addresses and not shown for privacy reasons. 
Some POFs for some properties will be positive and some will be negative. 
But in general an annual POF change of 0% will give conservative results in the calculators on this website. School districts (and other taxing districts) 
should be conservative with 
other people's money. Customers (taxpayers/voters) of the calculators can choose to enter different annual POF change parameters as they see fit for 
their circumstances.
