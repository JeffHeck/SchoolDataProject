This next chart shows the estimated average annual taxes for just this levy for local property taxpayers.  The worst case scenario for taxpayers is usually the assumption of zero new construction. Another reasonable scenario to consider is continued new construction for each tax collection year of this one levy at the same pace as this year.

Notes:

The gray cell values were provided by the district in the voters' pamphlet and in the resolution in the description of the tax measure - namely the amount in dollars to be collected each year of the levy and the district's estimated future tax rates for the measure. Future tax rates are calculated by the amount in dollars to collect each year divided by the estimated Total AV for each year.

The green cell is the Total AV for 2024 which can be obtained from the county assessor or the Department of Revenue.

The blue cells are calculated from the values in the other cells.

For example, the {2026 Total AV} = {2026 District's Levy Amount} / {2026 District's Estimated Levy Tax Rate} X 1000
