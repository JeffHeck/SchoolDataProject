## Summary

For the April 27th, 2021 special election:
- There are 11 school district measures from 11 school districts from 8 counties. 
- 9 of the measures are Enhancement Levies advertised as EP&O Replacement Levies.
- 1 measure, from the Orcas Island SD, is advertised as a Replacement Capital Projects / Technology Levy.
- 1 measure, from the Edmonds SD, is a Capital Projects Levy for new building construction and building maintenance. This is the largest levy this election at $180M. The projects in this 2021 Edmonds SD levy were 
on the ballot last year, 2020, as part of a $600M Edmonds SD bond which failed to achieve 60% approval. This scaled down levy version only needs 50% voter approval. Similar to the 2020 bond, no pro/con statements in a voters' pamphlet 
were allowed.
- 10 of the school districts, including Edmonds, did not allow pro/con arguments for a voters' guide or pamphlet.
- 1 school district (Orcas Island SD) allowed pro/con arguments for the voters' pamphlet - but only pro arguments were gathered and published. No con arguments.
- Only 1 county (San Juan) out of the 8 with school measures provided a voters' pamphlet to its voters. Voters' pamphlets usually have both pro and con arguments and rebuttals for each measure. For this election, San Juan was only able to gather and published pro arguments
for all of its measures. <br> [San Juan County Voters' Pamphlet for the April 27th 2021 Election](https://www.sanjuanco.com/DocumentCenter/View/22545/FINAL---2021-April-Special-Local-Voters-Pamphlet?bidId=)
