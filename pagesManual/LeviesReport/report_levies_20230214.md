## Calculator methodology

For these property tax impact estimate calculators, a Proportional Obligation Factor (POF) method was used.

Using the 2022 Total District Assessed Value (AV), the POF of the sample parcel was calculated:

POF = (2022 Sample Parcel AV) / (2022 Total District AV)

The POF was then multiplied by the total amount that the district expects to collect each year for the duration of the measure in question (bond or levy) 
to obtain the estimated taxes for the sample parcel for the measure.

Using this methodology, it doesn’t matter if all properties increase in AV by 10% or all decrease in AV by 10% (which could happen in a recession). 
The tax collection schedule shown in the charts and tables would still apply for the sample parcel. The sample parcel's proportion of obligation for the bond debt 
or levy remains the same over the bond payback or levy period. Tax rates, however, would change. If all properties increase in AV by 10%, the tax rate for the measures would 
decrease by approximately 10%. If all properties decrease in AV by 10%, the tax rate for the measures would increase by approximately 10%.

Note for the POF annual change parameter for the enhanced calculator versions:

For parcels that are increasing in POF (Proportional Obligation Factor), a positive POF annual change will give more accurate results. 
For parcels that are decreasing in POF due to rapid new construction or for other reasons, a negative POF annual change will give more accurate results. 
However a value of 0 will generally be slightly conservative and will generate estimates that are usually within 5% of actual costs. 

It is the author's opinion that county assessors (in all 39 WA counties) should be providing these calculators for their constituents. 

Example calculator calculation:

Issaquah SD

Total District AV for 2022: $40,480,082,421

Sampler parcel AV for 2022: $1,100,000

POF for 2022 assumed to be the same for years 2023 - 2026: $1,100,000 / 40,480,082,421 = 2.717E-5

Enrichment Levy amount to collect in 2023: $61,000,000

Sampler parcel's 2023 tax for the Enrichment Levy: POF * (Enrichment Levy amount to collect in 2023) = 2.717E-5 * $61,000,000 = $1,658

Similarly for the years 2024 - 2026

2024 tax = 2.717E-5 * $64,000,000 = $1,739

2025 tax = 2.717E-5 * $67,000,000 = $1,821

2026 tax = 2.717E-5 * $70,000,000 = $1,902

## Analyses of the bond cost analyses presented by districts

### An analysis of the Elma SD's cost analysis

![Elma SD's bond cost analysis](pagesManual/LeviesReport/20230214/ElmaSD_CostAnalysis.png "Elma SD's bond cost analysis")

The district’s “cost analysis” on its taxpayer funded website and in its resolution is illogical and is underestimating the cost to taxpayers. See the image with the red border.

From the district’s bond management company’s report, this bond will be paid back with interest by local property taxpayers over 21 years - so from 2024 through 2044.

The district's example home illogically maintain its AV (assessed value) for every year of those 21 years. Yet the district is assuming the Total AV of all taxable properties increase 
22% in 2023 and then increase steadily every year hence. 

The district is not being consistent. A $300,000 AV home in 2022 will, using the Total AV growth of the district, have a value of $683,000 approximately in 2044.

If the district reps would have been a little more accurate and transparent, and stated their assumptions correctly, they should have calculated:

For an example home with a 2022 AV of $300,000

the average annual bond tax (to cover principal and interest): $1,400 per year for 21 years

If one assumes a negative 1.5% proportional obligation factor change each year (for example if the pace of new construction continues despite high interest rates and high inflation), 

the average annual bond tax (to cover principal and interest): $1,170 per year for 21 years

The district’s estimate of $67 per month (they used month instead of year) calculates to $804 per year.

Their estimate is 74% too low.

($1400 - $804) / ($804) = 74%

or, for the conservative case, 46% too low.

($1170 - $804) / ($804) = 46%

See the cost estimating calculator link above.

___

### An analysis of the Napavine SD's cost analysis

![Napavine SD's bond cost analysis](pagesManual/LeviesReport/20230214/NapavineSD_CostAnalysis.png "Napavine SD's bond cost analysis")

The district’s “cost analysis” on its taxpayer funded website and sent as a mailer using taxpayer money is illogical and is underestimating (by about 50%) the cost to taxpayers. See the image with the red border.

From the district’s bond management company’s report, this bond will be paid back with interest by local property taxpayers over 26 years. So from 2024 through 2049. The bond interest will be 
more than the advertised bond principal.

The example homes shown illogically maintain their AVs (assessed values) for every year of those 26 years. Yet the district is assuming the Total AV of all taxable properties increase 23% in 2023 and then 
increase steadily every year hence. 

The district is not being consistent. A $300,000 AV home in 2022 will, using the Total AV growth of the district, have a value of $507,000 in 2049.

If the district reps would have been a little more accurate and transparent, and stated their assumptions correctly, they should have calculated:

Example home with a 2022 AV of $300,000

Average annual bond tax (to cover principal and interest): $611 per year for 26 years

See the cost estimating calculator link above.

___


### An analysis of the Orting SD's cost analysis

![Orting SD's bond cost analysis](pagesManual/LeviesReport/20230214/OrtingSD_CostAnalysis.png "Orting SD's bond cost analysis")

Good news, bad news.

The good news.
The district correctly explains that voters are voting on dollar amounts, NOT rates. 

The district first selects how much it wants in taxes each year for the next 22 years. 

Then the district makes an estimate on the Total AV (assessed value) for all taxable properties for each of those 22 years.

Then the district calculates their guesstimated bond tax rate for each year.

For a given year:

Bond tax rate for year = (Bond taxes to collect for year) / (Total AV for year) X 1000

The bad news.

What the district does not clearly state is that voters are deciding to allow the district to collect the tax amounts each year to cover the bond payback over 22 years to cover bond principal and bond interest. 

The advertised bond principal for this bond is $150,000,000

What is not stated is that, with high inflation and high interest rates, the district’s bond management company estimates that the bond interest will add another $100,000,000 to also be paid by property taxpayers bringing the total to $250,000,000

Even with if rapid new construction continues somehow with our high inflation and high interest rates over the next 22 years, say 2% average growth a year,
the property owner of a parcel with a $500,000 AV as of 2022 will pay:

$38,000 over the next 22 years

$22,000 for his/her share of bond principal

$16,000 for bond interest

Or an average, $1,700 per year

See the cost estimating calculator link above.

___

### An analysis of the Steilacoom SD's cost analysis

![Steilacoom SD's bond cost analysis](pagesManual/LeviesReport/20230214/SteilacoomSD_CostAnalysis.png "Steilacoom SD's bond cost analysis")

The district’s “cost analysis” on its taxpayer funded website and in its mailer (also paid for by taxpayers) is illogical and is underestimating the cost to taxpayers. See the image with the red border.

From the district’s bond management company’s report, this bond will be paid back with interest by local property taxpayers over 21 years - so from 2024 through 2044.

The district doesn’t even attempt to put an example parcel’s cost impact for this bond in its campaign materials. Instead, they just show a bar chart for 4 future years (2024-2027) with a $1.26 bond tax rate as their guess.

This bond has a 21 year payback scheduled. There is no mention of what happens in years 2028-2044.

For that tax rate of $1.26 the district fails to mention their assumptions for rapidly increasing Total AV (assessed value) of all taxable properties within the district’s boundaries. 

Taxpayers/voters are not voting on a tax rate. They are voting on an amount.

For a more accurate, logical cost estimating calculator, please see the link above.

An example home with a 2022 AV of $500,000 can expect to pay approximately $1,020 per year on average for the next 21 years. About $600 of that goes to pay principal and the other $400 as bond interest.

The district fails to mention high inflation and high interest rates.
