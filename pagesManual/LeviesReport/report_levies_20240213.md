## Summary
### Overview
Listed below are the the types and counts for the tax measures for the February 13th 2024 election that have been analyzed to date:
- Bonds: 21
- Enrichment Levies: 129
- Capital / Tech Levies: 52

Remaining levies to analyze: 9

### Local voters' pamphlet (LVP) statistics
- Bonds
    - Number of bonds =  21
    - Number of bonds with pro statements =  18
    - Number of bonds with con statements =  6
    - Number of bonds with phony con statements =  0

- Enrichment, capital and tech levies
    - Number of levies =  190
    - Number of levies with pro statements =  138
    - Number of levies with con statements =  41
    - Number of levies with phony con statements =  3

## Bond summary

### Total bond cost to local property taxpayers in each school district tax area with a bond measure
![Bond totals: principal + estimated interest and fees](pagesManual/LeviesReport/20240213/BondSummaryTotals.png "Bond totals")

Data source: Each district's bond/levy projection datasheet

### Total bond cost to owners of properties with 2023 assessed values (AVs) of $500,000
![Bond totals for example properties: principal + estimated interest and fees](pagesManual/LeviesReport/20240213/BondSummaryParcels.png "Bond totals")

$500,000 was chosen since it is approximately the median of the median home AVs in the school districts with tax measures.

The conservative assumption used was that the POF (proportional obligation factor) as of 2023 remains constant over the term of the bond. The interested reader can use the 
cost impact estimating calculators (linked below) for the bond and district of interest. An annual POF change parameter can be entered in the calculators as well as different AVs. 
The county assessor's office can assist with calculating the historical POF change parameter for any property. The POF = (The example property's AV for a given year) divided by (The Total AV of all 
properties in the district's tax area for the same year).

## Calculator methodology

School district reps often think and say they need to correctly guess the future 
Total AV for their district's tax area for each of the future years of their tax measures. Their assumption is incorrect and ends up misleading voters/taxpayers. 
And district reps' incorrect logic also usually leads to underestimating the true costs of their measures to taxpayers.

In contrast, for the property tax impact estimate calculators on this website, the author uses a Proportional Obligation Factor (POF) method. 

Using the 2023 Total District Assessed Value (AV), the POF of the example property was calculated:

POF = (2023 Example Property AV) / (2023 Total District AV)

The POF was then multiplied by the total amount that the district expects to collect each year for the duration of the measure in question (bond or levy) 
to obtain the estimated taxes for the example property for the measure.

Using this methodology, it doesn’t matter if all properties increase in AV by 10% or all decrease in AV by 10% (which could happen in a recession). 
The tax collection schedule shown in the charts and tables would still apply for the example property. The example property's proportion of obligation for the bond debt 
or levy remains the same over the bond payback or levy period. Tax rates, however, would change. If all properties increase in AV by 10%, the tax rate for the measures would 
decrease by approximately 10%. If all properties decrease in AV by 10%, the tax rate for the measures would increase by approximately 10%.

Note for the POF annual change parameter for the enhanced calculator versions:

For properties that are increasing in POF (Proportional Obligation Factor), a positive POF annual change will give more accurate results. 
For properties that are decreasing in POF due to rapid new construction or for other reasons, a negative POF annual change will give more accurate results. 
However a value of 0 will generally be slightly conservative and will generate estimates that are usually within 5% of actual costs. 

It is the author's opinion that county assessors (in all 39 WA counties), using sound accounting principles, should be providing these 
calculators for their constituents. 

Example calculator calculation:

Centralia SD

Total District AV for 2023: $4,131,948,094

Example property's AV for 2023: $350,000

POF for 2023 assumed to be the same for years 2023 - 2025: $350,000 / $4,131,948,094 = 8.471E-05

Enrichment Levy amount to collect in 2024: $6,700,000

Example property's 2024 tax for the Enrichment Levy: POF * (Enrichment Levy amount to collect in 2024) = 8.471E-05 * $6,700,000 = $568

Similarly for the year 2025

Enrichment Levy amount to collect in 2025: $7,600,000

2025 tax = 8.471E-05 * $7,600,000 = $644


### POF proof

For any particular future year:

(1) {Tax For An Individual Property For The Year} = {Tax Rate For The Year} X {Property’s AV For The Year}

(2) {Tax Rate For The Year} = {Known Total Tax To Collect For The Year} / {Total AV For The Year}

The apparent problem is that the {Property’s AV For The Year} is not known and the {Total AV For The Year} is not known. 
That's 2 unknowns. But we have 2 independent equations. 2 equations, 2 unknowns. Algebra to the rescue.

We can substitute {Tax Rate For The Year} from (2) into (1)

(1a)  {Tax For An Individual Property For The Year} = {Known Total Tax To Collect For The Year} / {Total AV For The Year} X {Property’s AV For The Year}

But {POF} = {Property’s AV For The Year} / {Total AV For The Year} 

Therefore:

(1b) {Tax For An Individual Property For The Year} = {Known Total Tax to Collect For The Year} X {POF}

POF stays relatively constant for an individual property over many years. The POF for an individual property can be accurately calculated for the current year and used for future years.

Individual properties' AVs and therefore Total AVs substantially fluctuate from year to year.

This is why even if guesstimated future Total AVs (and therefore future guesstimated tax rates) were accurate, they are not necessary. 
And worse, future guesstimated tax rates can be set to almost anything by just adjusting future Total AVs. 
Select a higher future Total AV growth, then the future tax rate will be lower. Select a lower future Total AV growth, then 
the future tax rate will be higher. However, the POF for an individual property does not change as property AVs rise or fall. 
School districts and other taxing districts should be prohibited from stating their guesstimated future tax rates on their tax measure resolutions 
and in their campaign materials. 
That practice misleads voters. School districts, of all institutions, should teach and practice proper logic and mathematics, accurate 
financial analysis, and ethical behavior. 

Voters/taxpayers are voting on amounts in dollars - not guesstimated, inaccurate, future tax rates. 

If school districts still want to show future rates for their new measures, they should then assume no change in Total AV from the current year and THEN calculate their future rates. Citizens can then calculate their 
future levy amounts based on the value of their properties' current year AV.
