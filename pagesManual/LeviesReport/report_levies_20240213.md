## Calculator methodology

For these property tax impact estimate calculators, a Proportional Obligation Factor (POF) method was used.

Using the 2023 Total District Assessed Value (AV), the POF of the sample parcel was calculated:

POF = (2023 Sample Parcel AV) / (2023 Total District AV)

The POF was then multiplied by the total amount that the district expects to collect each year for the duration of the measure in question (bond or levy) 
to obtain the estimated taxes for the sample parcel for the measure.

Using this methodology, it doesnâ€™t matter if all properties increase in AV by 10% or all decrease in AV by 10% (which could happen in a recession). 
The tax collection schedule shown in the charts and tables would still apply for the sample parcel. The sample parcel's proportion of obligation for the bond debt 
or levy remains the same over the bond payback or levy period. Tax rates, however, would change. If all properties increase in AV by 10%, the tax rate for the measures would 
decrease by approximately 10%. If all properties decrease in AV by 10%, the tax rate for the measures would increase by approximately 10%.

Note for the POF annual change parameter for the enhanced calculator versions:

For parcels that are increasing in POF (Proportional Obligation Factor), a positive POF annual change will give more accurate results. 
For parcels that are decreasing in POF due to rapid new construction or for other reasons, a negative POF annual change will give more accurate results. 
However a value of 0 will generally be slightly conservative and will generate estimates that are usually within 5% of actual costs. 

It is the author's opinion that county assessors (in all 39 WA counties) should be providing these calculators for their constituents. 

Example calculator calculation:

Centralia SD

Total District AV for 2023: $4,131,948,094

Sampler parcel AV for 2023: $350,000

POF for 2023 assumed to be the same for years 2023 - 2025: $350,000 / $4,131,948,094 = 8.471E-05

Enrichment Levy amount to collect in 2024: $6,700,000

Sampler parcel's 2024 tax for the Enrichment Levy: POF * (Enrichment Levy amount to collect in 2024) = 8.471E-05 * $6,700,000 = $568

Similarly for the year 2025

Enrichment Levy amount to collect in 2025: $7,600,000

2025 tax = 8.471E-05 * $7,600,000 = $644
