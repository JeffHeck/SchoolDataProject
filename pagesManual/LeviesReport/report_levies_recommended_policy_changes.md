## (1) 

County auditors (not the taxing jurisdictions) are to be entirely responsible for finding pro and con committee members for the 
voters’ pamphlet. Resolutions must be due early enough to allow county auditors at least 1 full week to advertise and find 
volunteers for the committees. 

## (2) 

Up to 3 people can be on a committee. Preference is first given to the measures’ jurisdiction residents. Remaining open slots 
must be open to all county residents. Both groups are to be selected on a first-come first-served basis.

## (3) 

Once selected, at least 3 business days must be given to the committees to write and submit their statements. After statements 
have been submitted, committees must be given at least 2 business days to write their rebuttals.

## (4) 

Pro and con committee statements max word length: 250 words

Pro and con committee rebuttals max word length: 75 words

## (5) 

For bond measures, the principal amount, the bond management company’s estimate for total bond interest, the total dollars to 
taxpayers (principal + interest), and the estimated bond payback period in years must all be clearly stated in the resolution 
for the voters’ pamphlet. No guesstimated rates (covering up to 20+ years of the bond) are to be included.

## (6) 

For bond measures, as part of the resolution submission packet, the applicable bond management company’s bond/levy projection 
datasheet is to be included.

## (7) 

For replacement levies, the actual amounts collected and actual rates (and the best estimates for the current year if still unknown) 
for the previous levy for each of the previous levy years, are to be included in the resolution along with the amounts only (no 
guesstimated future rates) for each year of the new levy. For all non-replacement levies, such as capital levies, the requested 
amounts to be collected each year must be stated in the resolution. Future guesstimated rates must not be included.

## (8) 

For all property tax measures, the county assessor (using sound accounting practices) must provide a taxpayer cost impact analysis 
to be included in the resolution submission packet. Taxing jurisdictions must give the county assessor at least 3 weeks before 
the submission deadline to create those cost impact analyses. Jurisdictions can post those and only those cost impact analysis 
reports on their websites, fliers, and mailers. The county assessor’s cost impact must include an example house and an example 
apartment showing the cost impact estimate of the tax measure. The house and apartment’s future assessed values (AVs) must grow 
at the same pace as the estimated growth for the Total AV of the properties in the taxing area.

## (9) 

Doxxing is prohibited in statements and rebuttals.
