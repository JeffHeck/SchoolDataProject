## Recommended policies

### (1) County auditors are responsible to select pro and con committee volunteers for the voters’ pamphlet.
County auditors (not the taxing jurisdictions) are to be entirely responsible for finding pro and con committee members for the voters’ 
pamphlet. Resolutions should be due early enough to allow county auditors at least 1 full week to advertise and find volunteers for the 
committees. 

### (2) Up to 3 people can be on a committee.
Preference is first given to the measures’ jurisdiction residents. Remaining open slots should be open to all county residents. Both 
groups are to be selected on a first-come first-served basis.

### (3) Number of days allowed for committees to write and submit statements and rebuttals.
Once selected, at least 3 business days should be given to the committees to write and submit their statements. After statements have 
been submitted, committees should be given at least 2 business days to write their rebuttals.

### (4) Max word count for statements and rebuttals.
Pro and con committee statements max word count: 250 words

Pro and con committee rebuttals max word count: 75 words

### (5) Resolution requirements for bonds.
For bond measures, the principal amount, the bond management company’s estimate for total bond interest, the total dollars to taxpayers 
(principal + interest), and the estimated bond payback period in years should all be clearly stated in the resolution for the voters’ 
pamphlet. No guesstimated rates (covering up to 20+ years of the bond) are to be included.

### (6) Bond payback schedule for bonds.
For bond measures, as part of the resolution submission packet, the applicable bond management company’s bond/levy projection datasheet 
is to be included.

### (7) Resolution requirements for replacement levies and non-replacement levies.
For any levy described as a replacement levy, the actual amounts collected and actual rates (and the best estimates for the current year 
if still unknown) for the previous levy for each of the previous levy years, are to be included in the resolution along with the amounts 
only (no guesstimated future rates) for each year of the new levy. For all non-replacement levies, such as capital levies, the requested 
amounts to be collected each year must be stated in the resolution. Future guesstimated rates must not be included.

### (8) County assessors must create the property taxpayer cost impact analyses.
For all property tax measures, the county assessor (using sound accounting practices) must provide a taxpayer cost impact analysis to be 
included in the resolution submission packet. Taxing jurisdictions must give the county assessor at least 3 weeks before the submission 
deadline to create those cost impact analyses. Jurisdictions can post those and only those cost impact analysis reports on their websites, fliers, 
and mailers. The county assessor’s cost impact should include an example house and an example apartment showing the cost impact estimate of the 
tax measure. The house and apartment’s future assessed values (AVs) should grow at the same pace as the estimated growth for the Total AV of the 
properties in the taxing area.

### (9) No doxxing permitted.
Doxxing is prohibited in statements and rebuttals for the voters’ pamphlet. 

### (10) All property tax measures should only be permitted on the August (Primary) and November (General) elections.
No tax measures are to be permitted on the February or April elections.


## Reasons for these recommended policies

### (1) Voters only receive one-sided debates in the voters’ pamphlets.

### (2) Voters only receive one-sided arguments from campaign materials (that are usually inaccurate) provided by school districts (using taxpayer money) in the guise of information fliers and information articles on the districts’ websites.

### (3) Taxing jurisdictions such as school districts have a clear conflict of interest with being tasked with finding and selecting con committee members for the voters’ pamphlets for their own measures.

### (4) Voters and property taxpayers do not receive accurate estimates of the cost impacts to the tax measures they are voting on.

### (5) There is no consistency among the 39 WA counties regarding pro/con statements and rebuttals in the voters’ pamphlets.

### (6) Almost all tax measures are only run in the lowest voter turnout month of the year (February).
