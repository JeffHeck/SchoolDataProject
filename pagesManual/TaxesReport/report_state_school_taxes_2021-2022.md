## Summary
From recent surveys, the author estimates that 95-99% of WA voters have misconceptions of the State School Part 1 and Part 2 
property tax categories on their property tax bills. They think that the taxes collected for these 2 categories are sent to 
the State and the State then sends a small portion (10-20%) back to their local school district while the other 80-90% of 
those State School taxes collected go to other school districts or other uses somewhere in the State. However, in actuality (except for 11 school districts 
out of the 295 school districts in WA) 100% of property taxpayers' State School Parts 1&2 taxes are returned to their local school 
district. And in fact the State needs to send substantially more to their local school district often on the order of 4 to 5 
times as much as the State School tax amounts collected. This extra State funding is primarily from State Sales Tax taxpayers.

Property taxpayers incorrectly think that approximately 20-25% of their property taxes goes to their local school district when 
a more accurate figure (accounting for the State School Parts 1&2 property taxes) is closer to 55-70%

## Surplus or deficit term definition
Surplus (or deficit) used in this report is defined as: The amount of State School Parts 1&2 property taxes paid by the school district area's property taxpayers to the State 
minus the funding amount sent from the State to the school district.

All properties within school district tax areas within a county have the county's State School property tax rate. 
The obvious question though is, why are the State School property tax rates different for each county? 
Why are some so high? 
The reason is that some counties are not necessarily up to date in 
their assessments for property values in general for one reason or another. The State compensates for this by auditing each county each year. When the State auditors 
find underestimation of assessed 
values, the State then applies a higher State School property tax rate. While this is logical and fair for State School tax collection, it 
highlights a problem of the 70 school districts that span multiple counties. This accuracy compensation factor is not applied for school district 
bonds and school district levies. So residents in counties with accurate, up to date assessed values are paying disproportionately more than their counterparts 
in the same school district but in the neighboring county for school district bonds and levies.

## Methodology
The OSPI's F196 Budget Report data for the 2021-2022 school year was used to gather the State funding amounts sent to each school district.

The Department of Revenue (DOR) tax reports were used to gather the State School 1&2 property tax rates and amounts for tax years 2021 and 2022. 

Then the average was calculated to align with the 2021-2022 school year data from the OSPI's reports.
