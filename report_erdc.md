## ERDC definitions
- "First year enrollment is defined as having an enrollment record at a postsecondary institution at some point in academic year following graduation, which is defined as the summer term immediately following graduation through spring term of the next calendar year. If a student enrolled at a 2-year and a 4-year institution in the year, they are categorized as a 4-year enrollee."
- "Persistence is defined as continued enrollment at any institution in the second year after high school graduation."
