The Education Research & Data Center (ERDC) compiles data on high school graduate outcomes. The following analysis specifically focuses on the latest ERDC data as of this writing on 2 year and 4 year college enrollments, 
college persistence, 
and remedial college course taking by high school graduates. Interactive charts were created summarizing and comparing all of Washington State's public school districts and public high schools on these measures.

## ERDC definitions
- "First year enrollment is defined as having an enrollment record at a postsecondary institution at some point in academic year following graduation, which is defined as the summer term immediately following graduation through spring term of the next calendar year. If a student enrolled at a 2-year and a 4-year institution in the year, they are categorized as a 4-year enrollee."
- "Persistence is defined as continued enrollment at any institution in the second year after high school graduation."
- "Pre-college courses, also referred to as remedial or developmental courses, are courses used by institutions to prepare students for college-level Math and English courses."
