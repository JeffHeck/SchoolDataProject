This report focuses on school district expenditures. WA's school districts and the OSPI (Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction) generally underreport per pupil expenditures (PPE) since they exclude 
capital outlays and interest on debt in their calculations. A recommended improved definition of per pupil expenditures is used in the following analysis 
that is similar to the definition used by the NCES (National Center for Education Statistics).
