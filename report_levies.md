## Methodology

For this analysis, the annual assessed value (AV) growth rates (increases or decreases) for the example property owner's property were set to the same values as the Total District Levy AV Growth Rates. 
The Total District Levy AVs were calculated from the levy amounts and levy estimates obtained from the sample ballots.

The spreadsheet data and chart for the West Valley SD (Spokane) are shown below.

## Sources

Levy amounts and levy rates were obtained from current election and previous election sample ballots from each respective county elections department. 
10 counties had all their sample ballots readily available on their websites.
For the 7 counties that did not have either their current or past sample ballots online, a public records request was made to obtain electronic copies.
