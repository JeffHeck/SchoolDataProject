___

## Methodology

For this analysis, the annual assessed value (AV) growth rates for the example property owner's property were set to the same values as the Total District Levy AV Growth Rates. 
The effect of this assumption is that the obligated proportion of the levy for the example property remains constant for each year in the analysis. 
The Total District Levy AVs were calculated from the levy amounts and levy estimates obtained from the sample ballots.

The spreadsheet data and chart for the West Valley SD (Spokane) are shown below.

___

## Sources

Levy amounts and levy rates were obtained from current election and previous election sample ballots from each respective county elections department. 
10 counties had all their sample ballots readily available on their websites.
For the 7 counties that did not have either their current or past sample ballots online, a request was submitted to obtain electronic copies.

School districts' levy fact sheets and levy flyers posted on their official websites were reviewed for misleading words.
